# Brick topQuadrant SHACL wrapper

Install with the optional `withjre` extra (for example, `uv pip install ".[withjre]"`)
to automatically provision a local JRE via the `install-jdk` package. The downloaded
runtime is stored under `~/.brick_tq_shacl/jre` by default and is used by the bundled
TopQuadrant SHACL tooling when no system Java is available.
